# Greetings App

## Description

The Greetings App is a simple Android application that allows users to enter their name and language preference to receive a personalized greeting. It demonstrates basic Android UI elements, user input handling, and dynamic content display.

## Features

*   **Personalized Greetings:** Users can input their name to get a custom greeting.
*   **Language Preference:** Users can specify a preferred language (e.g., Java or Kotlin, based on the input hint).
*   **Interactive UI:** The app features a clean and modern user interface with input fields, a button, and an image display area.
*   **Styled Components:** Utilizes `CardView` for a structured layout and custom styling for UI elements like `EditText` and `Button`.

## Technologies Used

*   **Kotlin:** The primary programming language for development.
*   **Android SDK:** For building native Android applications.
*   **XML:** For designing layouts.
*   **AndroidX Libraries:**
    *   `ConstraintLayout` for flexible and efficient layouts.
    *   `CardView` for creating card-based UI elements.
    *   `AppCompat` for backward compatibility.
    *   `Material Components` for modern UI elements (implicitly, given the styles and some dependencies).

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    ```
2.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    *   Open Android Studio.
    *   Click on "Open an Existing Project".
    *   Navigate to the cloned directory and select it.
3.  **Build the project:**
    *   Let Android Studio sync the Gradle files.
    *   Click on "Build" > "Make Project" or run the app directly on an emulator or physical device.

## How to Use

1.  Launch the app on your Android device or emulator.
2.  You will see a welcome message.
3.  Enter your name in the "Enter Your Name" field.
4.  Enter your preferred programming language (e.g., "Java" or "Kotlin") in the "What language do you prefer..." field.
5.  Tap the "Say Hello!" button.
6.  (Expected behavior, assuming MainActivity.kt handles this) A greeting message will likely be displayed, or the ImageView might change based on the input.
